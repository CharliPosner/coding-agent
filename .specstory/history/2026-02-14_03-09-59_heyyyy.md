tell me a  joke

Here's a programming joke for you:

Why do programmers prefer dark mode?

Because light attracts bugs! 🐛💡

Got any coding projects you're working on, or need help with anything technical? I'm here whenever you're ready!

## User

Here's another one for you:

Why don't programmers like nature?

It has too many bugs and not enough documentation! 🌲🐞📚

How about one more?

A SQL query walks into a bar, walks up to two tables and asks, "Can I join you?" 🍺

Alright, I'll stop there before I overflow your humor buffer! Let me know if you need help with any actual code when you're ready! 😄
